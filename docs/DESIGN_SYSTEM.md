# Darshan — Design System & Art Direction (v0.1)

Darshan is not an interface.
It is an atmosphere.

Design must transmit:

- silence
- presence
- sacred minimalism
- emotional flow
- the living time

The UI should feel like a modern crystal temple:
soft darkness, breath, light emerging.

---

# 1. Core Principle

## One Screen Forever
Darshan never becomes a dashboard.

Depth unfolds through:

- rhythm
- reveal
- layers
- silence

Not through menus.

---

# 2. Visual Mood

Darshan is:

- nocturnal
- luminous
- minimal
- gentle
- timeless

Avoid:

- bright saturation
- heavy gradients
- gamification aesthetics
- noisy UI

---

# 3. Color System (Atmospheric)

## Base Palette

### Void Black (Background)
- #050506

### Deep Night
- #0B0C10

### Soft Mist White (Text)
- #F5F5F7

### Moon Grey (Secondary)
- #B8B8C0

### Crystal Glass (Borders)
- rgba(255,255,255,0.10)

### Glow Accent (Minimal)
- rgba(255,255,255,0.18)

---

## Elemental Tones (Invisible Guidance)

Elements should not become rainbow colors.
They are subtle shifts of mood:

### Earth
- grounded, heavier opacity
- slower motion

### Water
- soft blur, gentle flow

### Fire
- slightly brighter pulse

### Air
- lighter spacing, floating feel

### Ether
- emptier space, more silence

No explicit color coding.
Elements are felt, not labeled.

---

# 4. Typography

Darshan uses typography as breath.

## Primary Font (Recommended)
- Inter (modern clarity)

## Optional Sacred Serif (Headings only)
- EB Garamond or Cormorant

## Rules
- Large spacing
- Light weights
- No bold aggression
- Text is calm

Example:

Title: 32px / font-light  
Body: 14–16px / opacity 0.7  

---

# 5. Layout

## Centered Ritual Layout

Always:

- center alignment
- vertical breathing space
- orb as the heart

Structure:

Header (Darshan)
Time Pulse (sun/moon)
Crystal Orb
Interaction Box
Revelation Steps

---

# 6. The Crystal Orb

The orb is the silent darshan.

## Requirements
- minimal animation (pulse, glow)
- no distraction
- slow rhythm

Orb represents:

- time
- consciousness
- stillness

Future upgrade:
video loop / WebGL sphere

---

# 7. Revelation Animation

Responses must unfold slowly.

## Timing
Each line appears every:

700ms – 1200ms

No sudden blocks of text.

Silence is part of UX.

---

# 8. Interaction Box

Only one field.

Placeholder:

"Respire... faça uma pergunta, ou deixe vazio."

Button:

"Receber Luz"

No extra controls.

---

# 9. Premium Layer (Portal)

Paywall must feel like a temple door.

Not:

"Pay to continue"

But:

"You received the key.
Do you want to open the full path?"

Button:

"Open Premium"

---

# 10. Image Sigil Style (Future)

Sigils must be:

- abstract
- sacred geometry
- dark background
- soft glow
- no faces
- no text

A seal, not an illustration.

---

# 11. Accessibility & Calm

- High contrast text
- No flashing animations
- Motion always slow
- Minimal notifications

Darshan must regulate, not stimulate.

---

# 12. Summary

Darshan design is:

Silence + Light + Breath + Time

One screen.
One key.
One step.


---

# 13. Language & Localization (Portuguese First)

Darshan must function primarily in **Portuguese (pt-BR)**.

The atmosphere, tone, and ritual experience are rooted in Brazilian presence.

English is supported as an optional secondary layer.

## Core Language Rule

### Primary Experience
- All UI text defaults to Portuguese
- Oracular responses default to Portuguese
- Practices and invitations are written in Brazilian natural language

### Secondary View (Optional)
- English may be offered as a toggle
- English is never required for the main experience
- English must preserve the same calm ritual tone

---

## UX Copy Standards (Portuguese)

Darshan language must feel:

- gentle
- simple
- poetic without exaggeration
- present-focused

Avoid:

- technical astrology jargon
- overly mystical drama
- aggressive imperatives

### Approved Portuguese Examples

Placeholder:
"Respire... faça uma pergunta, ou deixe vazio."

Button:
"Receber Luz"

Closing:
"O que em você já sabe?"

Premium Portal:
"Você recebeu a chave. Quer abrir o caminho completo?"

---

## English Layer (Careful Translation)

English must not become corporate or mechanical.

Approved style:

"Breath... ask a question, or leave it empty."

"You received the key. Would you like to open the full path?"

---

## Implementation Recommendation (Minimal)

Use a simple i18n structure:

- default: pt-BR
- optional: en

Example:

/locales/pt.json  
/locales/en.json  

No complex multilingual UI.

Darshan remains one screen.

Language is a subtle switch, not a feature.

---

## Sacred Terms (Do Not Translate)

Some Sanskrit terms remain intact:

- Darshan
- Jyotish
- Prana
- Kala
- Sattva / Rajas / Tamas

They are explained softly, not replaced.

---

## Summary

Darshan speaks first in Portuguese.

English is a window, not the root.

Presence is always the language beneath both.
