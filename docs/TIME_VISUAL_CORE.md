# Darshan — Time Visual Core (v0.1)

Darshan must embody the living present visually.

This layer is minimal and symbolic:

## Base Features (Always Visible)

### 1. Sunrise & Sunset (Today)
Show the daily light cycle:

- Sunrise time
- Sunset time

This anchors the user in the real Earth-time.

### 2. Moon Phase Image (Now)
Display the current lunar phase as a simple image:

- New
- Waxing
- Full
- Waning

Moon = collective emotional pulse.

### 3. Central Crystal Orb (Dynamic Presence)
A minimal animated orb (video or CSS glow)
as the ritual center.

Not decoration:
it represents the silent darshan.

### 4. Single Interaction Box
One field only:

- Ask a question
or
- Leave empty for "Pulse of Now"

## Principle
UI remains one screen forever.
Depth unfolds through time, not through menus.
