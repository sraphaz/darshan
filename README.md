# DARSHAN  
### *Luz do Tempo*

Darshan is a minimalist darshan of the present.

It does not predict.  
It reveals.

A ritual experience of silence, symbolic clarity, and minimal right action.

## ✨ What is Darshan?

Darshan is designed to return the user to:

- presence  
- the living moment  
- emotional flow  
- body awareness  
- one simple step at a time  

Not information overload.  
Not fatalism.  
A key, revealed in layers.

## 🌑 Core Experience

Single interface. Always.

User enters:

- a question  
or  
- nothing at all

Darshan responds with a **7-line revelation**:

1. Light (oracular phrase)  
2. Jyotish Pulse (time quality now)  
3. Chinese Archetype (current year tone)  
4. Element (Ayurveda balance)  
5. Consciousness (guna tone)  
6. Minimal practice (safe grounding)  
7. Final presence question

## 🌸 Governance

Darshan is ethically guided by:

- the Darshan Protocol (non-fatalistic revelation)
- Ayurveda as balance (not medicine)
- the 12 Petals of the Mother (Sri Aurobindo)

Peace, sincerity, equanimity.
